## Critical Decisions Required

### 1. Event Store Architecture
**Question**: Should we use AWS EventBridge for domain events or implement a custom event store with DynamoDB?
- **Option A**: EventBridge (managed, scalable, but less control)
- **Option B**: Custom event store (more control, but more complexity)
**Need your decision**: Which approach aligns better with your scalability and maintenance preferences?

### 2. Query Processing Strategy
**Question**: How should we handle complex multi-document queries?
- **Option A**: Synchronous processing with timeout
- **Option B**: Asynchronous processing with WebSocket updates
- **Option C**: Hybrid approach based on query complexity
**Need your decision**: What's the acceptable response time for complex queries?

### 3. Medical Terminology Data Source
**Question**: Should we build a comprehensive medical terminology database or integrate with external APIs?
- **Option A**: Build internal database (more control, faster)
- **Option B**: Integrate with external medical APIs (more comprehensive, dependency)
**Need your decision**: What's your preference for data accuracy vs. system independence?

### 4. Caching Strategy
**Question**: What should be our caching strategy for frequently accessed data?
- **Option A**: Aggressive caching with eventual consistency
- **Option B**: Conservative caching with strong consistency
**Need your decision**: How important is real-time accuracy vs. performance?

## Success Criteria
- [ ] System handles 1000+ concurrent queries
- [ ] Average query processing time < 2 seconds
- [ ] 99.9% uptime with proper error handling
- [ ] Medical terminology accuracy > 95%
- [ ] Event-driven architecture with proper domain separation

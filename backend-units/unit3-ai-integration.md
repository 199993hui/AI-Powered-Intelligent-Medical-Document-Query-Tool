# Unit 3: AI Integration Services

## Overview
Integrate AWS Bedrock for medical document processing, text extraction, and intelligent search capabilities.

## User Stories
- **US-B3.1**: As a user, I want AI document processing so that medical data is extracted automatically
- **US-B3.2**: As a user, I want document search so that I can find relevant medical information
- **US-B3.3**: As a system, I want text extraction so that PDF content is searchable
- **US-B3.4**: As a user, I want confidence scoring so that I know extraction accuracy

## Files to Create

## API Endpoints

### Document Processing
```python
POST /api/documents/{id}/extract
# Trigger AI extraction for specific document
# Returns: extraction results with confidence scores

GET /api/documents/{id}/extraction
# Get cached extraction results
# Returns: structured medical data
```

### Search Functionality
```python
POST /api/search
# Search across all documents
# Body: {"query": "diabetes treatment", "filters": {...}}
# Returns: ranked search results

GET /api/search/suggestions
# Get search suggestions based on medical terminology
# Returns: suggested search terms
```

## Data Structures

### Extraction Result
```json

  "document_id": "uuid",
  "extraction_date": "timestamp",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "medical_entities": {
    "medications": [
      {
        "name": "Metformin",
        "dosage": "500mg",
        "frequency": "twice daily",

        "confidence": 0.88
      }
    ],
    "procedures": [

      }
    ]
  },

    "No adverse reactions to current medication"
  ],
  "summary": "Patient with well-controlled Type 2 diabetes...",
  "raw_text": "extracted text content..."
}
```

### Search Result
```json
{
  "query": "diabetes treatment",
  "total_results": 15,
  "results": [
    {
      "document_id": "uuid",
      "filename": "patient_record_001.pdf",
      "relevance_score": 0.92,
      "matched_content": "...diabetes treatment protocol...",
      "categories": ["patient_records"],
      "upload_date": "2024-01-15",
      "highlights": ["diabetes", "treatment", "protocol"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## AWS Services Integration

### Amazon Bedrock
- **Model**: Claude 3 or similar for medical text processing
- **Use Cases**: Entity extraction, summarization, classification
- **Configuration**: Model parameters, prompt templates

### Amazon Textract (Optional)
- **Use Cases**: OCR for scanned documents
- **Features**: Text detection, table extraction, form processing

### Amazon OpenSearch (Optional)
- **Use Cases**: Advanced search and analytics
- **Features**: Full-text search, aggregations, real-time indexing

## Configuration Updates

### Environment Variables
```bash
# AI Services
BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0
BEDROCK_REGION=us-east-1
TEXTRACT_ENABLED=true
OPENSEARCH_ENDPOINT=https://search-medical-docs.region.es.amazonaws.com

# Processing Settings
EXTRACTION_TIMEOUT=300  # 5 minutes
MAX_CONCURRENT_EXTRACTIONS=5
ENABLE_OCR=true
```

## Performance Considerations
- Asynchronous processing for large documents
- Caching of extraction results
- Rate limiting for AI service calls
- Batch processing capabilities

## Security & Privacy
- PHI (Protected Health Information) handling
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Access logging and audit trails
- Compliance with HIPAA requirements

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for AI service integration
- Mock tests for external AI services
- Performance tests for search functionality
- Accuracy tests for medical entity extraction

## Dependencies
- Unit 2 completion (DynamoDB service)
- AWS Bedrock access and permissions
- Medical terminology datasets
- Text processing libraries (spaCy, NLTK)

## Estimated Effort: 4-5 days

# Unit 1: Core Backend Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
Basic Flask API with S3 upload functionality for medical document storage.

## User Stories
- **US-B1.1**: As a developer, I want a basic Flask API so that I can handle HTTP requests
- **US-B1.2**: As a user, I want to upload PDF files so that they are stored in S3
- **US-B1.3**: As a system, I want CORS enabled so that frontend can communicate with backend
- **US-B1.4**: As a user, I want file validation so that only valid PDFs are accepted

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Files Created
- `app.py` - Main Flask application with upload endpoint
- `requirements.txt` - Basic dependencies (Flask, Flask-CORS, boto3)

### Features Implemented
- Flask app with upload endpoint (`POST /api/documents/upload`)
- S3 integration for `echomind-pdf-storage-sg` bucket
- Basic PDF validation (file header check)
- CORS configuration for frontend communication
- Health check endpoint (`GET /health`)
- Category support with checkbox selection
- S3 metadata and tagging for document organization
- Meaningful S3 folder structure with timestamps

### API Endpoints
```
GET  /health                    # Health check
GET  /api/categories            # Get available categories
POST /api/documents/upload      # Upload PDF to S3 with categories
```

### Configuration
- **AWS Region**: ap-southeast-1
- **S3 Bucket**: echomind-pdf-storage-sg
- **File Validation**: PDF header check
- **Categories**: patient_records, clinical_guidelines, research_papers, lab_results, medication_schedules
- **S3 Structure**: medical_documents/{timestamp}_{id}_{filename}
- **Max File Size**: No limit (to be added in Unit 2)

## Testing
- Manual testing with frontend upload component
- S3 bucket integration verified
- CORS functionality confirmed
- Category selection and S3 tagging verified
- Metadata storage in S3 confirmed

## Next Steps
Proceed to Unit 2 for enhanced backend services and proper configuration management.

# AI-Powered Intelligent Medical Document Query Tool

Transform unstructured medical PDFs into an intelligent, searchable knowledge base. Healthcare professionals can ask natural language questions and receive precise, contextually relevant answers with source citations.

## üè• Problem Statement

Healthcare professionals in Malaysia struggle with:
- **Time Waste**: 2-3 hours daily manually searching medical PDFs
- **Information Loss**: Critical details buried in complex PDF structures
- **No Knowledge Synthesis**: Cannot leverage collective institutional knowledge

## üöÄ Solution

AI-powered query tool that enables:
- Natural language search across all medical documents
- Instant answers with source attribution
- ChatGPT-like interface for medical professionals
- Intelligent document processing and indexing

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend (Flask API)
- **Document Processing**: PDF extraction with OCR, table detection, medical entity recognition
- **AI Search**: Vector similarity search using OpenSearch with medical embeddings
- **Answer Generation**: Google Gemini API for natural language responses
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for PDFs, OpenSearch for searchable chunks

### Frontend (React TypeScript)
- **Document Management**: Upload, categorize, view, and delete medical PDFs
- **AI Search Assistant**: Chat-like interface for natural language queries
- **Source Attribution**: Direct links to relevant PDF sections with relevance scores

### Cloud Infrastructure
- **AWS S3**: Secure PDF storage with presigned URLs
- **OpenSearch**: Vector search engine for semantic similarity
- **Google Gemini**: AI language model for answer synthesis

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

OPENSEARCH_ENDPOINT=https://your-opensearch-domain.amazonaws.com
OPENSEARCH_INDEX=medical_docs
S3_BUCKET=your-pdf-storage-bucket
DYNAMODB_CHAT_TABLE=chat-history
```

### Supported Document Categories
- `patient_records` - Patient charts, medical histories
- `clinical_guidelines` - Treatment protocols, best practices
- `research_papers` - Clinical studies, medical literature
- `lab_results` - Laboratory reports, diagnostic results
- `medication_schedules` - Drug information, prescriptions

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Document Upload
1. Navigate to Document Management
2. Click "Upload Documents"
3. Select multiple PDFs
4. Choose appropriate categories
5. Upload and wait for processing

### AI Queries
